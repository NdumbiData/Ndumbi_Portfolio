											<h1>About Me</h1>
											<p><strong>Hi, I’m Ndumbi Kimani</strong> &mdash; a data enthusiast, storyteller, and business strategist. I wear many hats, but at my core, I’m someone who thrives on transforming complex data into meaningful insights that drive impact. Over the years, my career has been a dynamic mix of curiosity, problem-solving, and a constant pursuit of growth.</p>
									
											<p>In a world overflowing with data, my mission is simple: <strong>make data work for people.</strong> Whether it’s helping businesses unlock opportunities, streamlining operations, or crafting stories from numbers, I believe in turning raw information into clear, actionable intelligence. Let me take you on my journey, from where it all began to where I’m headed next.</p>
									
											<hr>
									
											<h2>The Journey So Far</h2>
											<p>From the beginning, I have always been captivated by <strong>technology, patterns, and purpose</strong>. My education started with a <strong>Bachelor's Degree in Business Information and Technology</strong> at <strong>JKUAT (Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology)</strong>, where I honed my technical knowledge while building a strong foundation in understanding business systems.</p>
									
											<p>It was during these years that I realized something crucial &mdash; data was the bridge between <strong>technology and business growth</strong>. I learned that, with the right tools, data could predict outcomes, reveal solutions, and create opportunities that were invisible to the naked eye. This realization became the north star of my career.</p>
									
											<hr>
									
											<h2>A Career Built on Growth and Impact</h2>
									
											<h3>1. Business Intelligence at Digital Cradle East Africa</h3>
											<p>At <strong>Digital Cradle</strong>, I took on the challenge of elevating engagement across East Africa. By analyzing customer behavior and implementing strategic insights, we achieved a remarkable <strong>40% growth in audience engagement</strong>. My work involved building dashboards, creating performance reports, and refining strategies to connect with customers.</p>
											<p><em>Key skills:</em> Data analysis, Python, Tableau, customer insights.</p>
									
											<h3>2. Data Analyst at 10Alytics</h3>
											<p>At <strong>10Alytics</strong>, my focus was clear: empower decision-makers with clarity. I created <strong>interactive dashboards</strong> and reports that increased decision-making efficiency by <strong>30%</strong>. Businesses often struggle with scattered data, but by implementing clean, visual tools and analysis, I made it possible for teams to see the full picture.</p>
											<p><em>Key skills:</em> Power BI, SQL, predictive analytics.</p>
									
											<h3>3. Operations Lead at Print Dynamics Kenya</h3>
											<p>Taking on a leadership role at <strong>Print Dynamics Kenya</strong>, I managed over <strong>20 team members</strong> while streamlining operations and enhancing client satisfaction by <strong>25%</strong>. It was a fast-paced role that demanded a mix of <strong>strategy, communication, and data-driven decision-making</strong>.</p>
											<p><em>Key skills:</em> Team leadership, process optimization, client success.</p>
									
											<hr>
									
											<h2>What Drives Me</h2>
											<p>I’m driven by <strong>curiosity, creativity, and a desire to make a difference</strong>. Whether it’s uncovering hidden trends in data, automating processes to save time, or advising businesses on how to move forward, I find joy in solving problems and delivering results.</p>
									
											<p>Here are a few of my guiding principles:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Turning complexity into clarity</strong>: I believe that simplicity is power. The most sophisticated solutions are often clear, intuitive, and actionable.</li>
												<li><strong>Data is a conversation</strong>: Data tells us what’s working, what isn’t, and where opportunities lie. I treat data as a dialogue between teams, tools, and insights.</li>
												<li><strong>Continuous learning and adaptation</strong>: The world of data and technology evolves every day. I’m committed to learning new tools, improving my skills, and staying ahead of the curve.</li>
											</ul>
									
											<hr>
									
											<h2>My Toolbox</h2>
											<p>Over the years, I’ve built a versatile skill set that allows me to tackle challenges across the data landscape. Here’s a quick snapshot of the tools and skills I bring to the table:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, SQL</li>
												<li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Power BI, Tableau, Excel</li>
												<li><strong>Data Tools:</strong> Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn</li>
												<li><strong>Business Insights:</strong> Process optimization, performance reporting, decision analysis</li>
											</ul>

											<h2>What I Can Do for You</h2>
											<p>Are you looking to make sense of your data? Need someone to analyze performance, predict trends, or tell stories with numbers? Let’s work together.</p>
											<p>I specialize in:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Data Analysis & Business Intelligence</strong>: Unlocking insights from your data.</li>
												<li><strong>Interactive Dashboards & Reports</strong>: Turning numbers into clarity.</li>
												<li><strong>Process Optimization</strong>: Streamlining operations to improve efficiency.</li>
												<li><strong>Predictive Modeling</strong>: Using advanced analytics to forecast outcomes.</li>
											</ul>
									
											<hr>
									
											<h2>The Fun Side of Me</h2>
											<p>Beyond the numbers, I’m a human being who loves <strong>exploring ideas, learning new things, and making connections</strong>. When I’m not knee-deep in data, you’ll probably find me:</p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Reading</strong> about technology trends and real-world case studies.</li>
												<li><strong>Exploring new tools</strong> to improve efficiency and processes.</li>
												<li>Sharing a laugh over coffee &mdash; because good ideas often start with great conversations.</li>
											</ul>
